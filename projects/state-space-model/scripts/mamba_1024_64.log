Some weights of CustomMambaForCausalLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at /aifs4su/ziliwang/txw/InternLM/zecheng/hf_models/mamba-1.4b-hf and are newly initialized: ['backbone.embedding.weight', 'lm_head.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA H800') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance.
